Version 0.1

-Reduced turbine engine fuel consumption by 5x (helicopters can now be flown for several hours instead of twenty minutes)

Version 0.2

-Made rotors able to be added to non-helicopters
-Added ROTOR_SIMPLE to all rotors allowing all flying vehicles to be modified and retain FLYABLE boolean

Version 0.3
-Removed aero_engine_light from cumbustion.json
-It wasn't altered in any way by the mod and it's inclusion was not necessary.
-This should cause the mod to stop throwing an error when applied to version 10614 where the light aero engine doesn't exist.
