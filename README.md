# useable_helicopters
A Cataclysm DDA mod that makes helicopters fully craftable\modifiable.

Welcome to my helicopter mod! A few things you need to know:

Rotors are not craftable. You'll need to salveage them from crashed\working helicopters still.

Vehicle weight determines the number\size of engines required for liftoff.

Turbine engines currently accept nearly every type of fuel. This is how they are configured in vanilla and I haven't gotten around to changing it yet.
I will likely narrow the fuel types down in the future.

Rotors have a set diameter and will break if you allow a protruding object (any proper structure) within that diameter.

This diameter is:

15 tiles for Heavy Duty Military Rotors

8 for civilian rotors

16 for blackhawk

11 for osprey

E.G for the Heavy Duty Military Rotor the rotors will stick out 7 tiles in each direction from the tile the rotor is installed on.
I plan on pestering SomeDeadGuy to add a graphic to show this in his tileset. If he's unable\unwilling I'll probably do it myself.
